Hey Hitu. So I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm just going to say it — I think you should build something real. Not a tutorial project that sits in a GitHub graveyard. Not a demo you show once and forget. An actual product that actual people will use, backed by actual funding from one of the most exciting ecosystems in crypto right now.

The **Walrus Foundation** has an open RFP — a Request for Proposals — for a **decentralized Event Registration & Ticketing Platform**. They're looking for someone to build it. And I think that someone should be you.

Before you freak out — no, you don't need to know blockchain. You don't need to know Move or Sui or what "erasure coding" means. Not yet. That's what this guide is for. I put the whole thing together so you don't have to figure everything out from scratch.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand something that most developers in crypto still haven't figured out. And it's going to change how you think about building products forever.

## How to use this guide

Start from Tab 1 (you're here), go through it in order, and by the end you'll know exactly what you're building, why it matters, and how to get started. Here's what's inside:

    There's one feature in this platform that makes every other blockchain event app obsolete. You'll see it on the third page.

    Walrus stores your data by cutting it into pieces and scattering them across the planet. Somehow, that makes it MORE reliable, not less. I'll explain.

## Why I think you should do this

Look — you're sharp. You pick things up fast. And you have something most applicants won't: Claude Code as your development partner. Teams of 3-5 devs will be applying to this RFP. You, with Claude Code and the right plugins, can move just as fast. Maybe faster.

The Walrus ecosystem is early. Like, really early. The people who build now become the people everyone references later. "Oh you want to see how NFT ticketing works on Walrus? Look at what Hitu built." That's the position you'd be in.

And honestly? Event ticketing is broken in ways that are SO obvious once you see them. You'll read the next few pages and go "wait, THAT'S how it works? That's terrible." And then you'll see what you could build instead, and you won't want to stop.

And here's the thing — you'll have something working by the end of Week 1. Not a tutorial. A real smart contract, deployed on a real blockchain, that you built.

So yeah. Keep reading. I promise it gets good.
