## Think of your platform like a building

Before we get into any technology, I want you to picture a building. A real, physical building.

Every building has the same basic parts. There's a foundation that holds everything up. There are storage rooms where you keep things. There are locks on the doors so only the right people get in. And there's a front entrance where people walk in.

Your decentralized event platform works the same way.

- **Sui** is the foundation. It's the brain that processes everything — every ticket purchase, every event creation, every transfer. Nothing happens without Sui.
- **Walrus** is the storage rooms. It's where all your files and data live — cover images, event descriptions, encrypted ticket data. Everything that needs to be saved goes here.
- **Seal** is the locks. It decides who can access what. Only the ticket holder can see the venue address. Only the organizer can update the event. Seal enforces those rules with encryption.
- **ZkLogin** is the front door. It's how people walk in without needing a special key. They sign in with Google, and they're inside. No wallet setup, no seed phrases, no confusion.

## How they connect

Here's the simplest way to think about the flow:

```
A person arrives
        |
        v
   [ ZkLogin ]  ---- "Sign in with Google" ---- creates a Sui address
        |
        v
   [   Sui    ]  ---- the brain ---- processes transactions, owns objects
        |
        v
   [  Walrus  ]  ---- the storage ---- holds files, images, encrypted data
        |
        v
   [   Seal   ]  ---- the locks ---- encrypts/decrypts based on on-chain rules
```

That's it. Person walks in through ZkLogin. Sui handles the logic. Walrus stores the data. Seal protects it.

## Each piece gets its own page

Each of these technologies is powerful on its own, and they each have their own deep-dive page in this guide. I'll explain what they do, why they matter, and how they fit into your event platform.

Here's the order I'd suggest reading them:

1. **Walrus** — the storage layer
2. **Walrus Sites** — websites hosted on Walrus
3. **Sui** — the blockchain itself
4. **Move** — the smart contract language
5. **Seal** — the encryption layer
6. **ZkLogin** — the authentication layer

Don't try to understand everything at once. Read each page, let it sit. It'll click. Some of this stuff took me a while too. The key is to build the mental model first — the details fill in naturally after that.

  Walrus stores your event data across hundreds of nodes worldwide. But here's the wild part — even if two-thirds of those nodes vanish, your data survives. How? That's the first thing I want to show you.
