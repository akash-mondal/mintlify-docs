Building alone is hard. Building with a community is way better.

These are the places where Sui and Walrus developers hang out. Show up, ask questions, share what you're working on.

## Where to find people

### Sui Discord

The main developer community. This is where you ask technical questions, share progress, and get help when you're stuck. The Move and developer channels are especially active.

### Walrus Discord / Telegram

Walrus-specific channels for questions about storage, Walrus Sites, and the Walrus ecosystem. Smaller community, but the people there are deep in the stack.

### Twitter / X

Follow the key accounts to stay current:

- **@WalrusProtocol** — Walrus updates and announcements
- **@SuiNetwork** — Sui ecosystem news
- **@Myaborudev** — community developer accounts

Post about your progress. Share what you're learning. The ecosystem notices builders who show up consistently.

### Sui Forums

Longer-form discussions and proposals. Good for understanding where the ecosystem is heading and for deeper technical conversations that don't fit in a Discord message.

Don't be shy about asking questions. Everyone was a beginner once. And showing up in the community *before* you apply to the RFP signals commitment.

The evaluation criteria explicitly mention "engagement in the ecosystem." This is where you do it. It's not extra credit — it's part of the application.

  You've got the tools, the docs, the community, and the knowledge. Now here's the 12-week roadmap — starting with deploying your first smart contract to testnet before you write a single line of product code. That first transaction confirmation? It changes everything.
