Don't reinvent the wheel. Study what others have built.

These repos show real patterns for the technologies we're using. Each one solves a problem you'll face.

## Repos to study

### Tusk dApp

A reference Sui dApp implementation. Good for understanding how a full Sui application is structured — from smart contracts to frontend to wallet integration. Study the project layout and how the pieces connect.

### Walrus Sites examples

How to build and deploy on Walrus Sites. This is directly relevant — our platform will be deployed as a Walrus Site. Pay attention to the deployment scripts and configuration.

### Polymedia zkLogin Demo

A working ZkLogin implementation you can actually run.

[github.com/juzybits/polymedia-zklogin-demo](https://github.com/juzybits/polymedia-zklogin-demo)

This one's gold. ZkLogin is the trickiest part of our stack, and seeing a working implementation saves hours of guesswork. Study how they handle the OAuth flow and proof generation.

### Walrus Code Guide

Practical coding patterns for Walrus. Less theory, more "here's how you actually do this." Great reference when you're writing the Walrus integration layer.

Don't copy these wholesale. Read them to understand patterns. Then build your own. The goal is to understand *why* they made the choices they made, not to cargo-cult their code.

<Card title="You're going to get stuck. Here's where people actually help." icon="users" href="/toolkit/community">
  The Sui Discord has developers who've shipped what you're building. The Walrus channels have people deep in the storage layer. And showing up in these communities before you apply to the RFP? The evaluation criteria literally mention ecosystem engagement. This isn't optional.
