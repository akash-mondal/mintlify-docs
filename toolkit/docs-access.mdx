Want Claude Code to be able to look up Walrus and Seal docs on its own? Set up MCP — it gives Claude Code direct access to documentation.

## What's MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Claude Code fetch information from external sources. Instead of you copy-pasting docs into the conversation, Claude Code can go read them itself. It's like giving it a browser, but only for the sites you approve.

## Setting it up

You need two documentation servers — one for Walrus, one for Seal.

Add this to your Claude Code MCP config. You'll find it at `.claude/mcp_servers.json` in your project directory (create the file if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "walrus-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nicholasgriffintn/fetch-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_DOMAINS": "docs.wal.app"
      }
    },
    "seal-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nicholasgriffintn/fetch-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_DOMAINS": "seal-docs.wal.app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file and restart Claude Code. That's it.

## How it works

Now when Claude Code needs to look something up about Walrus or Seal, it can go straight to the source. You can ask things like:

- "How do I store a blob on Walrus?"
- "What's the Seal encryption flow?"
- "Show me the Walrus API for site deployment"

And Claude Code will fetch the answer from the official docs instead of guessing.
