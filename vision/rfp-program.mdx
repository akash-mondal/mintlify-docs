Okay, let's talk about the money part. Because none of this matters if you can't fund the build.

The **Walrus Foundation** is the organization that stewards the entire Walrus ecosystem. Think of them as the team making sure the decentralized storage layer, the sites platform, Seal encryption, and everything around it actually grows into something usable and vibrant. They're not a company selling a product. They're a foundation investing in the ecosystem's future.

And one of the ways they invest? The **RFP program**.

## What's an RFP?

RFP stands for Request for Proposal. It's exactly what it sounds like — the foundation publishes specific projects they want to see built, and they fund the teams who build them.

This is NOT a hackathon prize. Nobody's giving you \$500 and a pat on the back for a weekend prototype. This is **milestone-based grant funding** for a real product. You propose what you'll build, they evaluate your proposal, and if they accept it, you get funded at each milestone as you deliver working software. Real money for real work.

They publish these RFPs because they need specific applications to exist in the ecosystem. A protocol is only as useful as the apps built on top of it. Walrus needs a great event platform. They're willing to pay someone to build it. That's the deal.

## The process, step by step

Here's how it actually works from start to finish.

### 1. Application submission

You write a proposal and submit it. Proposals are reviewed on a **rolling basis**, which means there's no hard deadline where everyone gets judged at once. They review them as they come in.

That said — apply early. Rolling basis means first-come-first-evaluated, and if they find a proposal they love, the opportunity could close. Don't wait until you feel "ready." Ready is a myth. Apply when your proposal is solid.

### 2. Evaluation and review

A review committee goes through your proposal. They're looking at your technical approach, your timeline, your understanding of the problem, your team (more on that later). There might be interviews. There might be technical evaluations where they dig into your architecture decisions.

This isn't a rubber stamp. They're investing real money, so they want to make sure you can actually deliver. But it's also not adversarial — they want you to succeed. They need these projects built.

### 3. Final selection and onboarding

If they select you, there's a compliance step — **KYC/KYB** (Know Your Customer / Know Your Business). Standard stuff for any grant program. You sign agreements, set up the formal relationship, align on milestones and deliverables.

Nothing scary here. Just the legal and operational basics you'd expect from any professional funding arrangement.

### 4. Launch

You start building. You hit milestones. You get awards at each milestone. You have the foundation's support along the way — not just money, but access to the team, technical guidance, and ecosystem connections.

This is the part where it gets fun. You're not building in the dark. You've got funding, a clear roadmap, and people who want you to succeed.

## What if you're not selected?

Here's the thing — getting a "no" isn't the end of the world. If your proposal isn't selected, you get added to a **mailing list for future opportunities**. The foundation is constantly publishing new RFPs and funding new projects. A "not this time" could easily turn into a "yes" on the next one.

And honestly? Going through the process of writing a solid proposal — thinking through the architecture, the milestones, the market — that work isn't wasted. It makes everything you do next sharper.

## The Event Registration & Ticketing Platform RFP

This is the one we care about. The Walrus Foundation has published an RFP specifically for a **decentralized Event Registration & Ticketing Platform**. It's the project this entire guide is about. And it's **still accepting applications**.

Everything you've been reading — the broken state of events, the vision for what decentralized ticketing looks like, the features, the architecture — it all maps directly to what this RFP is asking for. This guide exists to get you from "that sounds interesting" to "here's my proposal."

## One more thing

The application isn't a test. It's a conversation. Show them you understand the problem, you have a vision for the solution, and you have the tools to ship it.

That's it. That's all they're looking for. Someone who gets it and can build it.

Now let's make sure you know exactly what they're evaluating.
