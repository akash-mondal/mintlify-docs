![How they'll judge you — technical strength, alignment, engagement, commitment](/images/evaluation-criteria.png)

Hitu, let's decode the evaluation criteria. Every grant program has a rubric. The Walrus RFP is no different. But reading a rubric and understanding what reviewers *actually* care about are two different things.

I'm going to walk you through each criterion and then translate it into what it means for *you* specifically.

---

## 1. Technical strength and execution

This is the big one. They want to see that you've thought through the architecture — not just "I'll use React and Move" but *how* the pieces connect, *why* you're making specific technical choices, and *what* happens when things go wrong.

Your milestones need to be realistic. If your timeline says "Month 1: Build entire smart contract layer, frontend, and integration with Walrus" — that's a red flag. It tells them you haven't actually built anything before. Real timelines have breathing room. Real timelines acknowledge that debugging takes longer than coding.

They also want to see that you can actually ship. Not just plan. Ship. Working software. Demonstrated capability.

<Tip>
**What this means for you:** Lead with Claude Code as your accelerator. Show a clear week-by-week plan where each week produces something demonstrable. Don't promise the moon in month one. Promise a working smart contract that handles event creation. Then build on it. Reviewers love seeing a builder who understands scope — someone who says "here's what I'll deliver by week 2, and here's how each milestone builds on the last." That's credibility.
</Tip>

## 2. RFP alignment with creative exploration

This one's subtle. They want you to address the RFP requirements — yes, obviously. But they don't want a copy-paste of their spec back at them. They want to see that you've internalized the goals and then brought your own thinking to the table.

Check the boxes, but then go further. If you have a better idea for how check-in should work, say so. If you think the RFP missed something important about the attendee experience, call it out. If you see a creative angle on NFT ticketing that nobody's proposed yet, pitch it.

They're funding builders, not contractors. Contractors do exactly what you ask. Builders do what you ask and then surprise you with something better.

<Tip>
**What this means for you:** Don't just list the RFP requirements and say "I'll build these." Take two or three features and show original thinking. Maybe it's a novel approach to proof-of-attendance. Maybe it's a creative use of Seal encryption that goes beyond basic ticket access. Maybe it's a gamification layer that rewards repeat attendees. Show them you're not just filling in blanks — you're designing a product.
</Tip>

## 3. Engagement in the ecosystem

This is the one most applicants underestimate. The foundation isn't just funding code. They're funding ecosystem participants. People who show up, engage, contribute, and help the community grow.

They want to see that you're part of the conversation. That you've joined the Sui Discord. That you've engaged in Walrus discussions. That you've asked questions, answered others' questions, shared your progress, given feedback.

Building in a cave and emerging with a finished product might work for solo indie projects. For a foundation grant? They want to see you in the community.

<Tip>
**What this means for you:** Start now. Join the [Sui Discord](https://discord.gg/sui). Find the Walrus channels. Introduce yourself. Ask a genuine question about building on Walrus. Share something you've learned. You don't need to be an expert — being curious and engaged is enough. When you submit your proposal, you want the reviewers to recognize your name. "Oh, that's the person who's been asking great questions in the developer channel." That's a massive advantage.
</Tip>

## 4. Team commitment and resourcing

They want to know you won't quit in month two. That you have the time, the tools, and the drive to see this through from proposal to production.

Traditional applicants list their team members, their experience, their availability. You're a solo builder. That's fine — but you need to frame it right.

<Tip>
**What this means for you:** Frame Claude Code as your development partner. This isn't spin — it's accurate. You're not a solo dev hoping for the best. You're a builder with an AI development partner that understands Move, knows the Sui ecosystem, can generate and debug smart contracts, and accelerates every stage of development. Describe your toolkit: Claude Code with the Sui Stack plugin, access to Walrus and Sui documentation piped into your dev environment, this entire guide as your roadmap. Show momentum — if you've already started prototyping, mention it. If you've already mapped out the architecture (which you will have after reading this guide), reference it. They want to see a builder who's already moving, not someone who'll start figuring things out after acceptance.
</Tip>

## The meta-point

Here's what ties all four criteria together. Reviewers aren't looking for perfection. They're looking for **signal**. Signal that you understand the problem deeply. Signal that you can build. Signal that you'll stick with it. Signal that you'll be a valuable part of the ecosystem.

Every part of your proposal should send clear, strong signal. No fluff. No buzzwords. No "leveraging synergies in the decentralized paradigm." Just clear thinking, realistic planning, and genuine enthusiasm for the problem you're solving.

You've got this. Let's look at what you'll actually need to deliver.
