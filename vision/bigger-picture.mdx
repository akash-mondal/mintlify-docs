![One pattern across every industry — remove the middleman, give ownership back](/images/dapps-wave.png)

Ok so before we dive into the RFP specifics, I want you to see something. Because ticketing is just one tiny corner of what's happening right now. People are using this same technology — the stuff you're about to learn — to rebuild finance, music, real estate, gaming, supply chains... basically every industry where middlemen have been extracting value for decades.

And it's not theoretical. It's happening RIGHT NOW.

## Finance — banks are getting outrun

Here's how banking works today: you deposit your money, the bank lends it out, earns interest on YOUR money, and pays you basically nothing. They charge you fees to hold YOUR cash. They take 3 days to settle a transfer. Three days! In 2026! We can video call someone on the other side of the planet in real time, but moving money between two accounts takes longer than shipping a package.

DeFi — decentralized finance — has processed over **$200 billion** in transactions. No banks. No middlemen. No 3-day settlement. Protocols like Uniswap let you swap currencies instantly. Aave lets you lend and borrow without a bank even knowing you exist. And it all runs on transparent, auditable code instead of trust in a suit behind a desk.

Want to really understand DeFi? [Watch this Finematics explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-O3r2YMWJ4) — visual, beginner-friendly, no jargon. It'll click after that.

On Sui specifically, this is already live. [Cetus DEX](https://www.cetus.zone) handles decentralized trading. [Suilend](https://suilend.fi) handles lending. Real money, real users, real volume — running on the same blockchain you're about to build on.

<Tip>
Go explore [Cetus](https://www.cetus.zone) for a few minutes. You don't have to trade anything. Just look at the interface. Notice how it looks like a normal financial app — because that's the point. The blockchain part is invisible to the user. That's the energy you want for your event platform.

## Music — artists are taking back their money

Spotify pays artists approximately **$0.003 per stream**. Three tenths of a cent. An artist needs roughly 300,000 streams just to make $1,000. Meanwhile, Spotify's CEO is worth $5 billion. The math doesn't add up because it's not supposed to — the system is designed to extract value from creators and funnel it to the platform.

Sound familiar? It's the exact same problem as Ticketmaster and event organizers. Who OWNS the relationship between the artist and the fan? Not the artist.

[Audius](https://audius.co) flipped this. It's a decentralized music platform where artists upload tracks and earn directly from listeners. No labels taking 80%. No platform deciding who gets promoted. The artist-to-fan relationship is direct, and the artist keeps their money.

This is the same "who owns the relationship" problem you're solving for event organizers and attendees. Different industry, identical pattern.

<Tip>
Pull up [Audius](https://audius.co) and browse around. Listen to something. Notice that it feels like Spotify — clean, fast, normal. That's a decentralized app running on blockchain infrastructure. Your event platform should feel this seamless.

## Real estate — $570 million tokenized and counting

This one's wild. Buying property has always been one of the most gatekept things in the world. You need massive capital, lawyers, brokers, months of paperwork, and a dozen middlemen who each take a cut.

[Chintai](https://www.chintai.io) has tokenized **$570 million** in real estate. [Lofty](https://www.lofty.ai) lets you buy fractional ownership in rental properties starting from **$50**. Fifty dollars. You can own a piece of an apartment building in Dallas for the price of a decent dinner.

And here's the part that should make your ears perk up: UBS — one of the largest banks on the planet, managing **$1.7 trillion** in assets — ran a tokenized fund transaction on blockchain. When a bank that big starts using this technology, it's not a fringe experiment anymore. The wave is real.

<Tip>
Check out [Lofty](https://www.lofty.ai) to see tokenized real estate in action. The UX is clean, approachable, and doesn't feel "crypto" at all. That's the bar for every dApp now — including yours.

## Gaming — players finally own their stuff

Think about every game you've ever played. Every skin you bought, every weapon you earned, every character you leveled up over hundreds of hours. What happens when the company shuts down the servers? Gone. All of it. You spent real money and real time, and you own exactly nothing.

The blockchain gaming market has crossed **$5 billion**, and the core idea is simple: players OWN their in-game items as NFTs. Your legendary sword isn't stored on some company's server — it's yours. You can sell it, trade it, or take it to another game.

On Sui specifically, games are launching with **sub-second transaction speeds**. No waiting around. No lag. Just fast, invisible blockchain transactions that feel like a normal game. And when the game company moves on to their next project? Your items still exist. They're yours.

"We shut down servers and your 1,000 hours vanish" becomes impossible when the assets live on-chain.

## Supply chain — scan and verify

Ever wondered if that designer bag is real? Or if the organic label on your groceries actually means anything?

[VeChain](https://www.vechain.org) tracks products from factory to shelf on blockchain. Every step — manufacturing, shipping, customs, warehouse, store — gets recorded as an immutable entry. Scan a QR code on a luxury handbag and you can see its entire journey. Where it was made, when it shipped, every hand it passed through.

No more "trust me, it's authentic." The proof is right there, on-chain, for anyone to verify.

This is the same principle behind your NFT tickets. A ticket on the blockchain is verifiable by anyone, anytime. No need to "trust" that a PDF is real. The proof is cryptographic and permanent.

<Tip>
Visit [VeChain](https://www.vechain.org) and look at their use cases. The supply chain tracking concept maps directly to what you're doing with event tickets — provable authenticity, transparent history, no faking it.

## Social media — your followers are YOURS

Right now, if you build an audience on Instagram, you don't own that audience. Instagram does. They decide who sees your posts. They can shadowban you. They can shut down your account and your entire community disappears overnight. You built it, but they hold the keys.

[Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz) is decentralized social media where YOU own your posts, your followers, your entire content graph. It's all on-chain. If you don't like the app you're using? Switch to a different one. Your audience comes with you. Your content comes with you. Your reputation comes with you.

Sound familiar? It's the exact same problem as event organizers being locked into Eventbrite. Build a community on their platform, and that community becomes their leverage over you. Lens is solving this for social media. You're solving it for events.

<Tip>
Explore [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz) and think about portable identity. A person's Lens profile follows them across apps. Your attendance NFTs and proof-of-presence records do the same thing — portable, composable identity for the event world.

## Advertising — killing the bots

The global digital advertising industry is worth over **$600 billion**. And a terrifying chunk of it is fake. Bot traffic. Fake clicks. Phantom impressions. Advertisers pay for eyeballs that don't exist, and the platforms that run the ads have very little incentive to fix it because fake clicks still generate revenue.

[Alkimi](https://www.alkimi.org) is running advertising on Sui — transparent, verifiable, and bot-resistant. Real results: **34% lift in sales intent** compared to traditional ad platforms. Because when you strip out the fraud and make everything auditable, advertising actually works better. Who would have guessed?

The $600 billion ad industry built on bots and fake clicks is about to get a very uncomfortable wake-up call.

## Loyalty and identity — already live on Sui

[TBook](https://tbook.com) runs loyalty programs on Sui with **2 million+ users**. Not a pilot. Not a testnet experiment. Two million real people earning and redeeming loyalty rewards through blockchain infrastructure.

Software companies are running license management on-chain — **35,000 daily activations**. That's right, the boring "does this user have a valid license" check is happening on blockchain because it's more reliable and transparent than traditional licensing servers.

And here's the direct connection to what you're building: the attendance NFTs your platform issues? Those ARE loyalty programs. Someone who attends five events gets a different status than someone who attended one. That's composable reputation. That's verifiable loyalty. And it's built into the core of what you're creating.

---

## The pattern

Read all of that again if you need to. Every single one of these follows the same pattern:

1. Take an industry where middlemen extract value
2. Replace them with transparent, auditable code
3. Give ownership back to users

Finance. Music. Real estate. Gaming. Supply chain. Social media. Advertising. Loyalty.

**That's EXACTLY what you're doing with event ticketing.**

You're not building some random app. You're applying a proven playbook — one that's already disrupting trillion-dollar industries — to an industry that's begging to be fixed.

---

## The Sui connection

And here's the thing — Sui is where a LOT of this is happening. The ecosystem you're about to build in already has DeFi, gaming, social, advertising, and loyalty running on it. Active users. Real transactions. Production infrastructure. Want proof Sui is alive? Check the [DappRadar rankings for Sui](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/sui) — real users, real volume.

Your event platform doesn't exist in isolation. It plugs into ALL of it.

Think about what becomes possible:

- An **attendance NFT** that qualifies someone for a DeFi airdrop on Cetus
- A **ticket** that unlocks exclusive in-game content for a Sui-based game
- **Cross-platform reputation** where your event attendance history follows you across every app in the ecosystem
- **Loyalty rewards** that compound across events, platforms, and communities
- A **verified attendee profile** that means something in DeFi, gaming, social, and beyond

That's not a roadmap for 2030. The infrastructure for all of this exists TODAY. You're building one piece of a much larger, interconnected ecosystem — and your piece makes every other piece more valuable.

<Tip>
Spend 10 minutes on the [Sui Ecosystem page](https://sui.io/ecosystem). Browse the categories. See what's already live. You're not building in a vacuum — you're joining a network of hundreds of projects, and your event platform connects to all of them.
</Tip>

## So yeah. It's not just ticketing.

You're not building a better Eventbrite. You're building a piece of a new internet — one where users own their data, creators keep their revenue, and middlemen get replaced by code that anyone can audit.

The wave is already here. DeFi proved it. Gaming is proving it. Music, real estate, advertising, social — they're all proving it right now.

You're just the one bringing it to events.

Let's look at the actual RFP you're going to apply to.
