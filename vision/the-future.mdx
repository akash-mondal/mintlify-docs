![Your version — verified, owned, permanent tickets with no middlemen](/images/the-future-vision.png)

Okay. You've seen how bad it is. The fees, the lock-in, the scalpers, the data black holes. All of it.

Now forget all that. Close your eyes for a second (okay, not literally — you're reading). I want you to picture what events could look like if you built something from scratch, with none of those constraints. No legacy systems. No platform overlords. Just... the right way.

This is your version.

## The attendee experience

Imagine this.

An attendee opens your platform. They sign in with their Google account — no wallet setup, no seed phrases, no browser extensions, nothing weird. It just works. They feel like they're using any normal website.

They browse events. Beautiful cards, clear details, maybe a filter or two. They find one they love. A rooftop networking night, a Web3 workshop, a local music showcase — whatever. They hit **Register**.

Their ticket arrives as an NFT they actually own. Not a PDF stuck in an email. Not a barcode locked inside some app. A real digital asset, sitting in their account, that belongs to them. They can transfer it if they want. They can prove they have it. Nobody can revoke it without their knowledge.

But here's where it gets wild.

The ticket contains **encrypted details** — the venue address, a personal QR code, a link to the event's private site — all locked so only the ticket holder can see them. Not the platform. Not some random hacker. Only them. The encryption lives on-chain, enforced by smart contracts, not by a company's promise to "keep your data safe."

And the event page itself? Hosted on **decentralized storage** that nobody can take down. Not a hosting provider, not a government, not a disgruntled ex-cofounder. It's just... there. Permanent and accessible.

**Now picture event day.**

The attendee walks up to the door. They open the app, pull up their NFT ticket, and scan it. The scan doesn't just check a database — it confirms their attendance **on-chain**. A verifiable, timestamped, immutable record that says "this person was here."

After the event, they receive a **proof-of-attendance NFT** — a permanent badge that lives in their wallet forever. It's not a participation trophy. It's a composable credential. Other apps can read it. Other platforms can verify it.

Weeks later, the event organizer drops an **airdrop** to all verified attendees — maybe early access to the next event, maybe tokens, maybe exclusive content. The attendee didn't have to sign up for a mailing list or hand over their email. Their presence at the event now counts toward **reputation**, future event access, loyalty rewards, community standing.

They showed up. They got credit. Automatically. Permanently.

That's the attendee experience you're building.

## The organizer experience

Now flip it around. You're the event organizer.

**No platform fees.** Not 10%, not 5%, not "just" 3.5% + \$1.50 per ticket. Zero. You keep what people pay. The only costs are tiny blockchain transaction fees — we're talking fractions of a cent.

Let's do the math. A 1,000-person event at \$50/ticket on Eventbrite? You lose about \$3,340 in platform fees alone. On YOUR platform? Blockchain transaction fees are fractions of a cent. That \$3,340 stays in YOUR pocket. Run 10 events a year? That's \$33,400 saved. Per year. Just by existing.

**Instant payments in crypto.** No waiting 5-7 business days. No payment processing delays. No "your payout is under review." Money moves when tickets sell. Period.

**Transparent attendee data you actually own.** You don't have to beg a platform for an export. You don't lose everything when you switch tools. The data is yours — on-chain, verifiable, portable.

**Composable event history** that follows your community. Every event you run, every attendee who shows up, every proof-of-attendance issued — it all builds on itself. Your tenth event benefits from the reputation of your first nine. Your community has a visible, provable track record.

Here's what the flow looks like:

You create an event. The metadata — title, description, cover image, dates — gets stored on **Walrus**, decentralized storage that can't be censored or taken offline. You set ticket tiers. Free tier, VIP tier, early bird pricing. You set capacity limits. You hit publish and it's live. Not "pending review." Not "waiting for approval from our trust and safety team." Live.

On event day, you pull up a **scanner tool**. Attendees scan in. You see real-time check-ins. You know exactly who's there.

After the event: **analytics** on attendance, engagement, ticket sales. **Exports** of attendee data. And the big one — **reward drops**. You can airdrop tokens, NFTs, access passes, or whatever you want to everyone who actually showed up. Verified. No faking it.

You're not renting someone else's platform. You're running your own.

## The ecosystem impact

Here's the part that'll blow your mind.

Everything I just described — the tickets, the attendance records, the proof-of-presence — it's all **on-chain data**. Open. Composable. Readable by any application that wants to use it.

That means event attendance becomes **composable data**.

Picture this: someone attends your Web3 workshop, gets their attendance NFT, and the next day Cetus DEX automatically qualifies them for an early access airdrop — because your attendance NFT is composable data that Cetus can read. No APIs to connect. No partnerships to negotiate. It just works because everything is on the same chain.

Other apps don't have to ask your permission to build on top of it. A conference app could gate exclusive content — "only accessible if you attended 3+ events this year." A loyalty platform could aggregate attendance across dozens of organizers and reward the most active community members. A DAO could use event participation as a voting weight. A job platform could verify that someone actually attended the workshops they claim on their resume.

Your platform isn't just an app. It's **infrastructure** for a new kind of event economy.

Every ticket issued, every attendance verified, every proof-of-presence minted — it all becomes a building block that other developers, other platforms, other communities can build on. You're not creating a walled garden. You're planting a public park.

And the craziest part? None of this exists yet. The ecosystem is wide open. The person who builds this first doesn't just get users — they set the standard. They define how event data works on Walrus. They become the reference implementation that everyone else builds around.

## So here's the punchline

This is what the **Walrus Foundation RFP** is asking someone to build.

Not a concept. Not a whitepaper. A working platform that does all of this — decentralized event creation, NFT ticketing, encrypted access, on-chain attendance, proof-of-presence, composable data.

They've written up the requirements. They've allocated the funding. They're waiting for proposals.

**That someone is you.**
