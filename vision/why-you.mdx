![The timing is unfair — infrastructure is live, nobody has built this, and someone wants to pay you](/images/why-you-hero.png)

Hitu, I'm going to be real with you. The timing on this is almost unfair.

Not unfair in a bad way. Unfair in the sense that everything — the technology, the funding, the tooling, the opportunity — is lining up at the same time. That doesn't happen often. Let me walk you through it.

## The infrastructure just became real

Walrus went to mainnet. Not testnet. Not "coming soon." Production-ready, live-on-the-internet mainnet.

That means the decentralized storage layer we've been talking about isn't theoretical anymore. You can store event data, images, entire application frontends on Walrus right now. Walrus Sites can host full web applications — not just static pages, but real interactive apps. Seal encryption is live, which means you can lock ticket details so only the holder can see them.

Six months ago, building what we're describing would've required duct-taping together a bunch of half-finished protocols. Today? The infrastructure is just... ready. Waiting for someone to build something real on top of it.

## Sui isn't a "maybe someday" chain

Let's talk about the blockchain you'll be building on.

Sui has sub-second finality. That means when someone buys a ticket, the transaction confirms before they can blink. No "pending" spinners. No waiting for block confirmations. It just happens.

But speed isn't even the best part. Sui has **native NFTs** — objects are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts bolted onto a token standard. It has **ZkLogin built in**, so your users can sign in with Google and never see a wallet prompt. It has a growing developer ecosystem with real documentation, real examples, and real people shipping real products.

This isn't a chain you're betting on. It's a chain that's already delivering.

## Someone is actively trying to pay you to build this

The Walrus Foundation runs an RFP program. RFP stands for Request for Proposal — basically, they've written up specific products they want to see built, and they're funding the teams that build them.

This isn't a hackathon where you have 48 hours to throw something together and maybe win a prize. This is milestone-based grant funding for a real product. You submit a proposal. If they accept it, you get funded at each milestone as you deliver working software. You get support from the foundation along the way.

They want this built. They're ready to pay for it. They just need someone to step up and say "I'll do it."

<Tip>
The RFP program isn't charity. It's the Walrus Foundation investing in their ecosystem. They need great applications to prove the platform works. You need funding and support to build something ambitious. Everybody wins.

## Nobody has built this well yet

This is the part that should make your heart race a little.

The Event Registration RFP is open. As in, right now. As in, nobody has shipped a production-quality decentralized event platform on Walrus yet. The territory is unclaimed.

First movers who build something excellent don't just get users — they become the reference implementation. The thing other developers point to when they want to understand how to build on Walrus. The standard that everyone else has to measure up to.

You're not competing against an established player with years of head start. You're walking into an empty room and getting to define what "good" looks like.

## You have an unfair advantage

Here's where I get to brag about what we've set up for you.

As a solo dev with Claude Code, you can move faster than teams of 3-5 people. I'm not exaggerating. Claude Code already knows how to write Move smart contracts for Sui — the Sui Stack plugin and Move quality skill mean you're not starting from zero on the hardest part of the stack. You'll be pair-programming with an AI that understands the exact ecosystem you're building in.

And this isn't just me being optimistic. There's a now-famous story about a Stripe employee — [someone with zero engineering training who built a production-quality app on a single 6-hour flight using AI](https://vercel.com/blog/how-stripe-built-a-game-changing-app-in-a-single-flight-with-v0). A complete non-engineer. One flight. A real, working application.

If someone with no coding background can do that on a plane with a laptop and an AI tool, imagine what you can do with Claude Code over a few weeks. With this entire guide laying out exactly what to build. With the Walrus and Sui documentation piped directly into your development environment. With me having already mapped out every feature, every screen, every smart contract.

Six months from now, when someone in the Sui Discord asks "has anyone built NFT ticketing on Walrus?" — you'll be the person who answers. Not because you were the smartest. Because you were the one who actually built it.

You're not going in blind. You're going in loaded.

## You're not the first person to think about this

I want you to read something. A developer named Ashutosh wrote about his personal journey rethinking event platforms after watching the centralized model fail over and over — [After the Meltdown: Rethinking Event Platforms](https://medium.com/t14g/after-the-meltdown-rethinking-event-management-platforms-d1fce0748a26). He walks through the same frustrations we've been talking about and arrives at the same conclusion: decentralized infrastructure is the answer.

The point isn't that he figured it out first. The point is that real developers, building real things, are independently arriving at the same idea. The problem is obvious. The solution is obvious. What's missing is someone who actually builds it.

That someone is you.

## So here's the deal

You don't need to know Move today. You don't need to understand erasure coding. You don't need to be able to explain how Seal encryption works under the hood or what a BFT consensus mechanism does.

You just need to understand what you're building and why — Claude Code handles the implementation.

Everything you need is in this guide. The vision. The features. The architecture. The ecosystem context. The design direction. The development toolkit. All of it. Laid out, explained, and ready for you to pick up and run with.

Imagine this: you open your laptop, you describe what you want to Claude Code, and you watch it write the smart contract. You test it. It works. Your first NFT ticket exists on Sui. You take a screenshot. You send it to me. And in that moment, you'll know — you can actually do this.

So keep reading.
