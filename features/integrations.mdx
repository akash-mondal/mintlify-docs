Your platform doesn't exist in isolation. Event apps, sponsor activations, loyalty programs — all of these can plug into your on-chain attendance data. You're building an API for the event economy.

## Event app integration points

Scheduling apps, networking apps, feedback tools — they all need to know who's attending and what they have access to. Your platform exposes that data through clean integration points. A networking app can query "who attended this session?" A feedback tool can verify "did this person actually go to the talk they're rating?" The on-chain data becomes the source of truth that other tools build on.

## Sponsor activations

Sponsors want to reach real attendees, not bots. With verified on-chain attendance, sponsors can reward people who actually showed up. "Visit our booth and scan your badge — here's an airdrop." "Attended all three days? Here's exclusive merch." The attendance proof makes sponsor activations trustworthy. No fake check-ins, no gaming the system. Sponsors get real engagement data, attendees get real rewards.

## Loyalty programs

On-chain data persists across events. That means you can build loyalty programs that span an entire event series — or an entire ecosystem. Attended five events this year? Here's a returning attendee discount. Been to every edition of this conference? Here's a lifetime badge. Cross-event reputation becomes possible because the data lives on a public chain, not siloed in some organizer's spreadsheet.

## The composability advantage

This is the big idea. Other developers can build on top of your platform's data. Someone could build a "conference matchmaking" app that connects attendees across multiple events. Someone else could build an analytics dashboard for organizers. A third person could build a sponsor ROI tracker. You don't have to build all of this yourself. You build the protocol layer — the attendance data, the ticket standards, the access proofs — and the ecosystem builds on top.

You're not just building an app. You're building a protocol that other apps can plug into.

That's every feature. You now know what you're building, inside and out. Next up: understanding the technology that makes it all possible.

**RFP requirement:** Integration points for event apps, sponsor activations, or loyalty programs that leverage on-chain attendance data.
