Your attendance NFT isn't just a souvenir. It's a key. Future airdrops targeted at "people who attended Sui Connect"? You're eligible. A new event offering discounts to returning attendees? You qualify automatically. Your event history becomes your reputation.

That's the thing most people miss about proof of attendance. They think it's a badge you look at once and forget. It's not. It's a credential that compounds over time.

## Airdrops based on attendance

Imagine a project launching a token and wanting to reward early community members. Instead of scraping Discord roles or trusting sign-up forms, they can just query the chain. "Who attended our three builder events this year?" Done. Airdrop targeted, verified, no faking it.

You don't need to fill out forms or claim anything. Your attendance record speaks for itself.

## Reputation systems

This is where it gets interesting. Your attendance history IS your credential. Went to five Sui hackathons? That says something about you. Attended every governance meetup for a year? That matters. Over time, your on-chain attendance builds a profile that's way more meaningful than a LinkedIn bio.

Other protocols can read this. DAOs can use it for governance weight. Event organizers can use it for priority access. It's composable — anyone can build on top of your attendance history.

## Follow-up campaigns

Organizers don't lose touch with their audience after the event ends. They can run follow-up campaigns targeted specifically at verified attendees. Not spam blasts to a mailing list — actual targeted outreach to people who were provably there.

"Hey, you came to our workshop last month. Here's early access to the tool we demoed." That kind of thing. Verified, relevant, not annoying.

## Cross-platform recognition

Here's the part that really matters long-term. Your attendance data isn't locked in one app. It lives on-chain. Other platforms, other apps, other ecosystems — they can all read it. A conference app can see you attended a related meetup. A job platform can verify you showed up to that training. Your proof of attendance travels with you.

No more "I swear I was there." The chain knows.

**RFP requirement:** Proof of attendance can later be used for airdrops, follow-up campaigns, or reputation systems.

<Card title="The event is over. But the relationship isn't." icon="message" href="/features/communication">
  Proof of attendance unlocks future value. But right now, between events, there's a gap — and how you fill that gap with reminders, updates, and community chat determines whether attendees come back.
