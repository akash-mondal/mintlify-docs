Here's the magic trick: your attendees sign up with their Google account. That's it. Behind the scenes, a zero-knowledge proof links their Google identity to a Sui address — but nobody, not even Google, can make that connection. Your attendees don't need to know what a blockchain is. They just click "Sign in with Google" and they're in.

No seed phrases. No browser extensions. No "please install MetaMask." Just a button they already know how to use.

## The biggest barrier in crypto

Let's be honest. The reason most people haven't used a blockchain app isn't because blockchain is bad. It's because the onboarding is terrible. Download a wallet. Write down 12 words. Don't lose those words or your money is gone forever. Fund the wallet. Approve a transaction. Pay gas fees.

Nobody's doing that to register for a meetup.

ZkLogin kills this entire problem. It takes the familiar "Sign in with Google" flow that billions of people already use and connects it to a Sui blockchain address behind the scenes. The user never sees the blockchain. They never need to.

## How it feels

Exactly like signing into any normal app. You click "Sign in with Google." A popup appears. You pick your Google account. You're in. That's the whole experience.

If you've ever used Luma, you know the vibe. Quick, clean, no friction. That's what we're going for — except everything is running on Sui under the hood.

## What happens behind the scenes

Here's the simplified version of what's actually going on:

1. **Google verifies identity.** The user signs in with Google, and Google issues a token that says "yes, this is really this person."

2. **A math proof gets generated.** A zero-knowledge proof is created that links that Google token to a Sui address. The key part: this proof proves the link exists without revealing the user's Google identity to the blockchain. Nobody looking at the chain can figure out which Google account is behind which address.

3. **A Sui address is derived.** The user now has a blockchain address. They didn't create it manually. It was derived from their Google identity through cryptographic magic.

4. **Transactions happen without a wallet.** When the user registers for an event, the transaction is signed using this derived address. No wallet popup. No gas fee confusion. It just works.

That's ZkLogin in a nutshell. Google verifies who you are. Math proves it without revealing it. Sui gives you an address. You transact without knowing any of this happened.

## Supported providers

ZkLogin isn't limited to Google. Sui supports multiple OAuth providers:

- **Google** — the primary one we'll use
- **Facebook** — for users who prefer it
- **Apple** — great for iOS-first audiences
- **Twitch** — perfect for gaming and streaming events
- **Kakao** — important for Korean market reach
- **Slack** — useful for professional and developer events

Each provider works the same way. The user signs in with whatever account they prefer, and ZkLogin handles the rest.

## Why this is a competitive advantage

Think about what this means for event organizers. You get all the benefits of blockchain — permanent tickets, verifiable attendance, decentralized data — without asking your attendees to learn anything new.

Your event platform feels like Luma. It runs on Sui. Your attendees never know the difference, and they don't need to. That's the whole point.

Every other blockchain event platform asks users to connect a wallet. We don't. That's the edge.

  The user clicked one button and they're in. But the next three seconds — picking a ticket, paying, and receiving something they actually own — that's where the invisible blockchain magic kicks in.
