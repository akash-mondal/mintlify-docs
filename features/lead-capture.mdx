description: "Networking, profile sharing, and follow-ups"

Events are networking goldmines. What if attendees could opt-in to share their profiles with each other? Wallet-based reputation links. Post-event follow-ups. All privacy-first, all opt-in.

## Opt-in profile sharing

Attendees choose what to share. Name, wallet address, social links — whatever they're comfortable with. Nobody gets their info without explicit consent. When two people want to connect, they both opt in. Simple handshake, no middleman scraping data behind the scenes.

## Wallet-based reputation links

Here's where it gets interesting. Because attendance is on-chain, you can build reputation graphs. "I attended the same 5 events as this person." That's a signal. That's trust. You're not connecting strangers — you're connecting people who already share context. The blockchain gives you proof of shared experience without revealing anything else.

## Post-event follow-ups

Organizers can reach out to verified attendees after the event. Not spam — targeted, relevant follow-ups to people who actually showed up. "Hey, you attended our DeFi workshop. Here's the recording and some resources." The difference is that the organizer can prove attendance, and the attendee already opted in to receive communications.

## Privacy-first, always

Everything here is opt-in. Nothing is scraped. Nothing is sold. Attendees control their own data. They can revoke access anytime. This isn't Web2 lead capture where your email ends up on 47 mailing lists. This is consent-based networking backed by cryptographic proof.

<Note>
**RFP requirement:** Lead capture and networking capabilities, such as opt-in profile sharing, wallet-based reputation links, or post-event follow-ups.
