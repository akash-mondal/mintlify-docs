Physical events need physical check-in. QR scanning at the door. NFC badges for all-day access. Maybe even badge printing on-site. The digital and physical worlds meet.

## Badge printing for in-person events

You've got a blockchain-based ticket. Great. But when someone walks up to a registration desk, they need something tangible. A printed badge with their name, their tier, maybe a QR code that links back to their on-chain ticket. The printer pulls from ticket data — name, role, access level — and produces a badge on the spot. No pre-printing stacks of badges and hoping everyone shows up.

## QR-based access validation

Every ticket generates a unique QR code. Scan it at the front door to check in. Scan it at session rooms to track which talks someone attended. Scan it at restricted areas to validate access level. One QR, multiple checkpoints. Each scan writes to the chain — or at minimum, to a local system that syncs later. You get real-time attendance data without slowing down the line.

## NFC badges — tap and go

NFC takes it further. Write the ticket data to an NFC chip embedded in the badge. Now attendees just tap. Tap at the door. Tap at lunch. Tap at the sponsor booth. It's faster than QR, works in low-light, and feels seamless. The badge becomes the ticket becomes the access pass becomes the attendance proof. All one thing.

## The physical-digital bridge

This is where your platform gets tangible. The blockchain ticket — this abstract digital thing — materializes as a physical badge someone wears around their neck. And that badge talks back to the chain. Check-in at the door? On-chain. Session attendance? On-chain. The physical and digital records stay in sync. When the event's over, the attendee has both a souvenir badge and an immutable attendance record.
