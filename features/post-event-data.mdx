After the event ends, the data doesn't disappear. It stays on Walrus, verifiable forever. Organizers can export anonymized attendance data for analytics. Attendees can showcase their record. Ticket sales reports for tax purposes? All there.

This is one of those things that sounds boring until you need it. And then you really need it.

## Event data persists on Walrus

In the traditional world, event data lives on some company's server. Company shuts down? Data's gone. Server migration goes wrong? Data's gone. Someone forgets to renew the hosting? You get the picture.

With Walrus, the data persists. It's stored across a decentralized network. No single point of failure. Your event from three years ago? Still there. Still verifiable. Still accessible. That's not a feature you appreciate until the alternative bites you.

## For organizers: analytics and exports

You ran an event. Now you want to know how it went. How many people actually showed up versus how many registered? What was the check-in pattern — did everyone arrive on time or trickle in? Which ticket tiers sold out first?

All of this data can be exported in anonymized form. You get the insights without compromising anyone's privacy. Build dashboards, run reports, plan your next event better. The data is yours to analyze, and it's trustworthy because nobody could have tampered with it after the fact.

## For attendees: showcase your record

Your attendance history isn't hidden in some organizer's database. It's yours. You can showcase it across the ecosystem. Apply to a DAO and point to your governance event attendance. Apply to a job and reference the workshops you completed. Build a public profile of the events that shaped your journey.

It's a portable, verifiable resume of everywhere you've been and everything you've participated in.

## Tax and revenue tracking

Nobody's favorite topic, but it matters. If you sold tickets, you need records. How much revenue came in? From which ticket tiers? Over what time period? Traditional platforms give you a CSV export and call it a day. Here, the records are on-chain and immutable. Your accountant can verify them independently.

Ticket sales reports, revenue breakdowns, transaction histories — all exportable, all verifiable. No "the server crashed and we lost the data." The data lives on Walrus. It doesn't crash.

## Everything stays verifiable

That's the thread running through all of this. The data isn't just stored — it's verifiable. Anyone can confirm it hasn't been altered. An auditor, a tax authority, a future partner doing due diligence. The integrity of your event data is guaranteed by the network, not by your promise.

<Note>
**RFP requirement:** Event data remains verifiable on Walrus. Organizers can export anonymized attendance data for analytics. Attendees can showcase their attendance record across the ecosystem. Ticket sales reports for tax.

  You've got analytics, exports, permanent records. Great. But here's the question that breaks most platforms: what happens when a user says "delete everything about me"? The answer on your platform is elegant — and it's the one thing GDPR lawyers actually smile about.
