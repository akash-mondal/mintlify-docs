Your ticket doesn't just get you in the door. It unlocks a whole Walrus Site — a decentralized website with the full event agenda, speaker bios, media, announcements. Think of it as the event's private internet, accessible only to ticket holders.

That's a pretty wild concept if you stop and think about it. Today, event info lives on some centralized website. The organizer posts the agenda on Eventbrite or their own domain. Anyone can see it. And if the site goes down or the organizer forgets to renew the domain? Gone.

With Walrus Sites, the event's content lives on decentralized storage. It can't be taken down. It can't be censored. It doesn't depend on a single server staying online. It just... exists.

## What's on the Walrus Site

Every event gets its own Walrus Site. Think of it as the event's home base. Here's what lives there:

- **Full agenda** — the schedule, session times, track breakdowns, everything. Updated in real time as the organizer makes changes.
- **Speaker bios and profiles** — who's presenting, their background, links to their work. Attendees can browse before the event and plan which sessions to hit.
- **Media** — photos, videos, recordings from the event (or past events). All stored on Walrus, all decentralized.
- **Announcements** — last-minute changes, weather updates, party locations, whatever the organizer needs to broadcast to attendees.
- **Networking info** — attendee directories, contact sharing, community links. The social layer of the event.

It's basically everything you'd expect from an event app, except it's not an app. It's a decentralized website that lives on Walrus.

## Token-gated access

Here's the key part. The Walrus Site isn't public. It's gated by your ticket NFT.

When you try to access the site, it checks: do you hold a valid ticket NFT for this event? If yes, you're in. If no, you see nothing. It's that simple.

This is token-gating at its cleanest. No login credentials. No email verification. No "enter your ticket code" form. Your wallet proves you have a ticket, and the site opens up. Ownership equals access, just like with the encrypted ticket details.

And it works both ways. If you transfer your ticket to someone else, they get access to the Walrus Site and you lose it. The gate follows the token, not the person.

## Why decentralized hosting matters

Let me paint a picture. You go to a conference. It's great. Six months later, you want to look up a speaker's talk or find that networking contact list. You go to the event's website and... it's gone. Domain expired. Page not found. All that content, vanished.

With a Walrus Site, that doesn't happen. The content is stored on Walrus — decentralized, persistent, and available as long as the storage is funded. The event could be over for years and the site is still there. The agenda, the recordings, the speaker info — all still accessible to anyone who holds (or held) a ticket.

That's the difference between building on centralized infrastructure and building on Walrus. One depends on someone keeping the lights on. The other just works.

## The experience

From the attendee's perspective, it's seamless. You have your ticket in your wallet. You tap a link. The Walrus Site loads. You see the full event content. You browse the agenda, check out speakers, read announcements. It feels like any other website. The decentralized part is invisible — it just works better and lasts longer.

From the organizer's perspective, they get a content platform that they don't have to maintain infrastructure for. No servers to manage, no hosting bills to worry about, no risk of downtime during the event when everyone's hitting the site at once. Walrus handles it.

That's the beauty of it. Better for attendees, easier for organizers, and more resilient than anything centralized could be.
