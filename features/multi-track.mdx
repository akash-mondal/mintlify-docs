Big conferences have multiple tracks. Different ticket tiers for different experiences. Workshops that need separate registration. Your platform handles all of it — different agendas, different attendee types, one unified system.

## Multi-track registration

A tech conference might have a main stage, a developer track, a design track, and a business track. Attendees pick their path when they register. Maybe they want access to all of them. Maybe just one. The point is, your platform models this natively. One event, many tracks, clean registration flow.

## Different ticket tiers per track

General admission gets you the main stage. VIP gets you the main stage plus the after-party. Speaker pass gets you backstage. Each tier is a different token with different access rights baked in. The ticket itself knows what doors it opens.

## Different agendas per tier

VIP sees a different schedule than general admission. They see the exclusive sessions, the private networking hours, the early access demos. The agenda adapts to the ticket. No confusion, no "sorry, this session is VIP only" at the door — the attendee's view is already filtered to what they have access to.

## Workshop registration within an event

Workshops are events within events. Limited capacity, separate sign-up, sometimes an extra fee. Your platform handles sub-registration. Buy a conference ticket, then register for specific workshops within it. Each workshop can have its own capacity limits and waitlists.

## One unified system for the organizer

This is the key part. The organizer doesn't juggle five different tools. One dashboard. One system. All tracks, all tiers, all workshops — visible in one place. Attendance data flows up to the event level. Revenue is tracked across tiers. It's complex for the attendee to navigate, but dead simple for the organizer to manage.

<Note>
**RFP requirement:** Multi-track or multi-flow registration support for larger events with different ticket tiers, agendas, or attendee types.
