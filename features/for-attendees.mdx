Imagine you hear about an amazing conference. A friend sends you a link. You click it.

Today, you'd land on Eventbrite. Fill in your name, email, phone number, credit card. Agree to terms you don't read. Get a PDF in your inbox. Show up, get scanned, get a lanyard. Leave. That's your whole experience. A week later you get spam from sponsors you never agreed to hear from. Two months later you can't even prove you were there.

Now imagine doing it through Hitu's platform.

## The attendee's dream, step by step

### Discover and sign in without the crypto stuff

You click the link. Beautiful event page. Clean design. All the details right there — what the event is about, who's speaking, when, where, ticket options.

You want to register. You tap "Sign in with Google." That's it. No wallet setup. No seed phrases. No browser extensions. No "connect your MetaMask." Just your Google account, the one you already have, the one you use for everything. Behind the scenes, ZkLogin creates a blockchain wallet for you automatically. You don't know it's there. You don't need to know. It just works.

This is huge, Hitu. The number one reason normal people don't use Web3 apps is the onboarding friction. Wallets, seed phrases, gas fees — it's a nightmare. Your platform skips all of it. The attendee thinks they're using a normal website. They are using a normal website. It just happens to have superpowers underneath.

### Browse tickets and pick one

Free tier. Early bird. VIP. Whatever the organizer set up. Clear pricing, clear perks, clear capacity limits. You pick the one you want and pay. Simple.

### Receive a ticket you actually own

Here's where things change. Your ticket isn't a PDF sitting in your email. It's not a row in someone else's database. It's an NFT — a real digital asset minted on the Sui blockchain — and it's yours. Sitting in your wallet. Under your control.

What does that actually mean? It means nobody can revoke it without your knowledge. It means you can transfer it to a friend if you can't make it. It means you can prove you have it without depending on any platform being online. It means if every server in the world went down except the blockchain, your ticket would still be valid.

It's yours the way a physical ticket in your pocket is yours. Except it can't be lost, can't be counterfeited, and can't be duplicated.

### See details only you can see

Your NFT ticket contains encrypted information — the venue address, your personal QR code, a link to the event's private page, maybe access credentials for an online component. All encrypted so that only you, the ticket holder, can decrypt and view it.

Not the platform. Not a hacker. Not even the organizer's ex-business-partner who still has admin access. Only you. The encryption is enforced by smart contracts on-chain, through a protocol called Seal. It's not a promise. It's math.

### Event day: scan in, get verified

You show up. Pull up your ticket in the app. Someone scans it at the door. But unlike a normal scan that just checks a database, this one records your attendance on the blockchain. A permanent, timestamped, verifiable record that says "this person was here, at this event, on this date."

You walked through a door. You just created a credential.

### After the event: proof that lasts

A proof-of-attendance NFT lands in your wallet. A permanent badge. Not a participation trophy — a verifiable credential that anyone can check. You attended this event. It's on-chain. It's real.

And then the fun starts.

**Airdrops.** The organizer drops early access to their next event to everyone who showed up. You're first in line, automatically, because your attendance is verified.

**Qualify for things.** Another event requires "attended 3+ community events this year" to register. Your proof-of-attendance NFTs prove that. No screenshots, no "trust me bro." Verifiable on-chain data.

**Build a reputation.** Every event you attend adds to your verifiable event history. Over time, you're not just "someone who registered." You're a proven community member with a track record. Other platforms, DAOs, and communities can see that and reward it.

Your event history isn't trapped in five different platforms' databases anymore. It's yours. It's portable. It goes wherever you go.

## But what about privacy?

Good question. Here's the deal.

You control your data. Your encrypted ticket details? Only you can see them. Your personal information? It's not sitting in some company's database waiting to be breached. It's encrypted on Walrus, and you hold the keys.

And here's the really important part — you can delete your Walrus blobs. Your off-chain data, the stuff stored on decentralized storage, you can remove it if you want. Your on-chain proofs stay — the fact that you attended is a permanent record — but the personal details attached to your experience are yours to keep or discard.

You get the permanence of on-chain proof without sacrificing control over your personal data. That's a combination that literally doesn't exist anywhere else right now.

## Why they'll love it

Attendees won't use your platform because it's "decentralized." They'll use it because it's better. Better onboarding. Better tickets. Better privacy. Better proof. Better rewards.

The blockchain part is invisible. The benefits are obvious.
