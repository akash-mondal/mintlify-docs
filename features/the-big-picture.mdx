![Three layers — creation, experience, verification](/images/platform-overview.png)

Okay Hitu, we've been through the vision stuff. You've seen how broken events are today. You've seen what the future looks like. Now it's time to talk about what you're actually building. Like, feature by feature.

But first, let me give you the one-sentence version.

**A place where anyone can create events and anyone can attend them, with real ownership, real privacy, and real proof — powered by Sui and Walrus.**

That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else is just details on how you get there.

## Who is this for?

Three groups of people, and you need to make all three of them happy.

### Organizers who want freedom

These are the people running events today on Eventbrite, Luma, or whatever else. They're tired of paying platform fees. They're tired of not owning their attendee data. They're tired of being locked into someone else's ecosystem where the rules change whenever the platform feels like it.

They want to create events, sell tickets, manage check-ins, and communicate with their community — all without a middleman skimming off the top or holding their audience hostage.

Your platform gives them that. Full control. Full ownership. Zero lock-in.

### Attendees who want to own their experience

These are the people buying tickets and showing up. Right now, their "ticket" is a database row they don't control, their data gets sold to sponsors, and they walk out with nothing to show for it.

They want real tickets they actually own. They want their personal details encrypted so only they can see them. They want proof that they attended — proof that follows them around, unlocks perks, builds a reputation.

Your platform gives them that. Real ownership. Real privacy. Real proof.

### Ecosystems that want composable data

This is the bigger picture — the developers, platforms, and communities that want to build on top of event data. Loyalty programs that span multiple organizers. Airdrops targeted to verified attendees. Reputation systems that actually mean something because the data is on-chain and verifiable.

Your platform gives them that. Open, composable, on-chain data that anyone can read and build on.

## The three layers

Here's how I think about the platform. There are three layers, and every feature fits into one of them.

### Layer 1: Creation

This is the organizer's world. Creating events, setting ticket tiers, configuring pricing, publishing to decentralized storage, managing approvals. Everything that happens before attendees show up.

### Layer 2: Experience

This is the attendee's journey. Discovering events, signing in with Google, buying tickets, receiving NFT tickets with encrypted details, checking in on event day, getting proof-of-attendance. Everything from "I found this event" to "I was there."

### Layer 3: Verification

This is where it all connects. On-chain proof of attendance. Composable credentials. Airdrop eligibility. Reputation that carries across platforms. Everything that happens because you built on a blockchain instead of a regular database.

Most event platforms only do Layer 1 and a bit of Layer 2. They completely ignore Layer 3 because they can't do it — their architecture doesn't support it. Yours does. That's your edge.

You're not building an app, Hitu. You're building infrastructure for a new kind of event economy. Every other platform that tries to add Layer 3 later will have to retrofit it. You're starting with it. That's not a feature advantage — it's an architectural one.

## How we'll walk through this

Each feature gets its own page. I'm going to walk you through every single one like I'm sitting across from you at a coffee shop. No jargon walls. Just "imagine this..." and then how it works.

We'll start broad — what organizers get, what attendees get, what the ecosystem gets. Then we'll zoom into specific features: event creation, NFT tickets, encrypted access, check-in flows, proof of attendance, all of it.

By the end of this section, you'll know exactly what you're building. Not in a hand-wavy "decentralized event platform" way. In a "I can describe every screen and every user flow" way.

Ready? Let's start with the people running the show.
