Imagine you're running a Web3 meetup. You've got a venue, a lineup of speakers, and a community that's pumped. Now you just need to get people in the door.

Today, that means going to Eventbrite or Luma. Creating an event. Watching them skim fees off every ticket. Waiting days for your money. Begging for an attendee export that gives you half the data you need. Losing your audience if you ever switch platforms.

Now imagine doing it your way. On your terms. With your platform.

## The organizer's dream, step by step

### Create an event in minutes

A beautiful, clean form. Title, description, date, time, location, cover image. Nothing complicated. Fill it in, and your event page is ready. But here's what's different — when you hit publish, the event data doesn't go to some company's servers. It gets stored on Walrus, decentralized storage that nobody controls and nobody can take down.

Your event. Your data. Permanently accessible.

### Set ticket tiers that actually make sense

Free tier for the community. Early bird for the keen ones. VIP with backstage access. Whatever you want. Multiple tiers, different prices, different perks, different capacity limits. You set the rules. No platform telling you what pricing models are "supported."

### Publish and it's live

No review process. No "pending approval." No trust-and-safety team deciding whether your community meetup meets their content guidelines. You hit publish and your event is live, discoverable, and hosted on decentralized storage. It's your event. You decide when it goes live.

### Watch registrations in real time

People start signing up. You can see it happening — real-time registration data, all transparent, all on-chain. Not a black box where the platform decides what metrics you get to see. Every ticket minted, every registration confirmed, right there in front of you. Transparent data you can actually trust because it's not filtered through someone else's dashboard.

### Event day: scan and go

Your attendees show up. They pull up their NFT tickets. You open the check-in tool — could be a phone, a tablet, whatever — and scan. The scan doesn't just mark them as "arrived" in a database. It records their attendance on-chain. A verifiable, timestamped record that can't be faked or altered after the fact.

You know exactly who showed up. Not who bought a ticket — who actually walked through the door. That distinction matters more than you'd think.

### After the event: this is where it gets good

The event's over. Here's what you can do now.

**Analytics.** Real data on who attended, when they checked in, ticket tier breakdown, attendance rate. Not the watered-down version a platform decides to share with you — the actual data.

**Export everything.** Your attendee list. Your registration data. All of it. It's yours. Take it wherever you want. Use it however you want. No export limitations, no "upgrade to Pro for full data access."

**Drop rewards to attendees.** This is the killer feature. You can airdrop tokens, NFTs, early access passes, discount codes — whatever you want — directly to everyone who actually showed up. Not everyone who bought a ticket. Everyone who was verified on-chain as present. Targeted rewards to real attendees. Try doing that on Eventbrite.

## The numbers that matter

Here's the part that'll make every organizer's jaw drop.

**No platform fees.** Not 3.5%. Not 9.95%. Zero. The only costs are blockchain transaction fees, and those are fractions of a cent on Sui. The money your attendees pay goes to you. All of it.

**No lock-in.** Your event data lives on decentralized storage. Your attendee relationships are on-chain. If you want to switch tools tomorrow, your data comes with you. Nobody's holding your community hostage.

**No middlemen.** There's nobody sitting between you and your attendees taking a cut for "platform services." You publish events. People register. Money moves. That's it.

## Why they'll switch

Organizers don't switch platforms because of ideology. They switch because something is obviously better for them. And "keep all your revenue, own all your data, reward your actual attendees, and never be locked in" is obviously better.

You're not asking them to learn crypto. You're not asking them to understand blockchain. You're giving them a better event tool that happens to be built on infrastructure they'll never have to think about.

That's the pitch. That's the product.

  Organizers love this. But the person buying the ticket? Their experience changes even more dramatically — and it starts the moment they click "Sign in with Google."
