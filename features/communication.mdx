Events need communication. Reminders before the event. Updates if something changes. Confirmations after registration. Maybe even an event chat where attendees connect before the big day. All of this can be built in — some on-chain, some through traditional channels, depending on what makes sense.

Not everything has to be decentralized to be useful. Communication is one of those areas where pragmatism wins.

## Email or wallet-based notifications

Two paths here, Hitu. Traditional email notifications for people who are comfortable with that. And wallet-based notifications for the crypto-native crowd who'd rather get pinged through their wallet than check their inbox.

The key is giving users the choice. Some people live in their email. Some people haven't checked theirs in weeks but monitor their wallet activity religiously. Support both.

## Reminders, updates, confirmations

The basics, but they matter. A confirmation when you register. A reminder the day before. An update if the venue changes or a speaker cancels. These are table-stakes features that every event platform needs.

The difference here is that your registration is on-chain, so confirmations aren't just "we got your email" — they're "your ticket exists on the blockchain, here's the proof." Updates can be pushed to everyone holding a ticket NFT for that event. Clean and targeted.

## Event chat

This one's optional, but it's powerful. Let attendees connect before the event even starts. "Anyone else going to the Sui workshop on Saturday?" "Looking for a carpool from downtown." "First time at one of these — what should I expect?"

Community starts before the doors open. An event chat makes that happen. It could live in the app, or it could bridge to existing platforms. The attendance NFT acts as your entry pass to the conversation.

## The hybrid approach

Here's my honest take. Not everything needs to be on-chain. Sending a reminder email doesn't need blockchain verification. A chat message doesn't need to be an on-chain transaction. The smart play is using on-chain where it adds trust and using traditional infrastructure where it adds speed.

On-chain for registration confirmations and ticket verification. Traditional channels for "hey, don't forget, the event is tomorrow at 7pm." Use the right tool for the job.

  The doors closed. The attendees left. On a normal platform, the data starts decaying immediately. But on yours, every check-in, every ticket sale, every attendance record is still sitting there — permanent, exportable, and about to become very useful.
