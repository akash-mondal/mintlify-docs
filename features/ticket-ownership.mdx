Bought a ticket but can't go? Transfer it to a friend. Sell it on a secondary market. The ticket is yours — you decide what happens to it. And because it's on-chain, there's no fraud. The blockchain proves it's real.

This might sound obvious, but it's actually radical. Right now, most ticketing platforms *don't let you do this*. Or they make it incredibly painful. Or they charge you a fee for the privilege of giving your own ticket to someone else.

Let's talk about what real ticket ownership looks like.

## Transfer: just send it

Your ticket is an NFT on Sui. Transferring it means sending it to another Sui address. That's it. No forms. No customer support tickets. No "transfers are not allowed for this event." You own the object, and Sui lets you send your objects to anyone.

Imagine this: your friend texts you the day before the event saying they can't make it. They open their wallet, tap your address, send the ticket. Two seconds later it's in your wallet with all the metadata, the QR code (re-encrypted for you via Seal), the whole thing. You're going to the event. Done.

This is how ownership should work. You bought it. It's yours. Move it wherever you want.

## Secondary market potential

Where there's ownership, there's a market. People will want to resell tickets they can't use. And because every ticket is a verifiable NFT, secondary markets can exist without the fraud that plagues traditional resale.

Think about what happens on StubHub or Craigslist today. You buy a "ticket" from a stranger and pray it's real. Half the time it's a screenshot or a duplicate. You don't know until you get turned away at the door.

With NFT tickets, the buyer can verify on-chain that the ticket was minted by the official event organizer, that it hasn't been used yet, and that the seller actually owns it. The blockchain removes all the guesswork. What you see is what you get.

## Anti-fraud: on-chain provenance

Every ticket has a history. You can trace it all the way back to the moment it was minted by the organizer's smart contract. This chain of provenance is unbreakable.

- **Is this ticket real?** Check if it was minted by the organizer's verified contract address. If yes, it's real. Period.
- **Has it been used?** Check the ticket's on-chain status. If it says "attended," someone already checked in with it.
- **Who owned it before?** The full ownership history is on-chain. You can see every transfer, every sale.

Counterfeiting becomes impossible. Duplicate tickets become impossible. The "I got scammed buying tickets" story becomes a thing of the past.

## Organizer controls

Now, here's where it gets nuanced. Just because attendees *can* own and transfer tickets doesn't mean organizers lose all control. The smart contract can enforce rules.

- **Non-transferable tickets.** The organizer can mint tickets that are soulbound — they can't be transferred at all. Think corporate events, free community meetups, or anything where resale doesn't make sense.
- **Royalties on resale.** If the organizer allows secondary sales, they can bake in a royalty. Every time the ticket changes hands, the organizer gets a cut. This is huge — it means organizers finally benefit from the secondary market instead of losing revenue to scalpers.
- **Transfer windows.** The organizer could allow transfers only up until 24 hours before the event. After that, tickets are locked to their current holder.
- **Whitelist-only transfers.** Tickets can only be transferred to approved addresses. Useful for invite-only events.

The beauty is that these rules are enforced by the smart contract, not by a platform's terms of service. They're code, not policy. They can't be bent, bypassed, or ignored.

## The big shift

Here's what I really want you to understand, Hitu. Traditional ticketing is built on a model where the *platform* controls everything. They decide if you can transfer. They decide if you can resell. They decide what happens to "your" ticket. You're a renter, not an owner.

What you're building flips that. The attendee is the owner. The ticket is their property. The organizer sets the ground rules at mint time, and after that, the smart contract enforces them without any middleman.

This isn't just a technical improvement. It's a fundamentally different power dynamic. Attendees get real ownership. Organizers get programmable rules. And platforms like yours? You just facilitate — you don't gatekeep.

That's the whole point. Build the tool, set the rules, and get out of the way. Let the blockchain handle the trust.

  Your NFT ticket doesn't just open the door. It opens an entire decentralized website — the event's private internet — with content only ticket holders can see. And it stays live long after the event ends.
