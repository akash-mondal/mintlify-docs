You should know who else is in this space. Not to copy them. Not to "take inspiration" and end up building a clone. But because knowledge is power, and walking into a room without knowing who's already there is a rookie move.

Look at these platforms. Understand what they do well. Understand where they fall short. Then design something that makes all of them feel incomplete.

## The players

### Luma

<Card title="lu.ma" icon="globe" href="https://lu.ma">
  The "cool kid" of event platforms.
</Card>

Luma is what happens when good designers build an event platform. Beautiful UI, smooth interactions, clean typography. They've become the default for crypto and tech events specifically because they look and feel premium. Their event pages are gorgeous. Their registration flow is minimal. They understand that an event platform is partly a marketing tool — the event page IS the first impression.

Where they fall short: it's still centralized. You're still renting their platform. Your attendee data lives on their servers. And their ecosystem lock-in is real — your Luma community doesn't travel with you if you leave.

### Eventbrite

  The incumbent everyone knows. Functional, reliable, expensive.
</Card>

Eventbrite is the Microsoft Office of event platforms. Everybody's used it. Everybody tolerates it. Nobody loves it. The UI feels like it was designed in 2015 and hasn't been meaningfully updated since. Their fee structure is aggressively mediocre — not outrageous enough to drive people away, but enough to sting on every ticket sold.

What they get right: reliability. Eventbrite works. It handles scale. It processes payments. It sends confirmation emails. It does the boring parts well. That's worth understanding even if you're building something fundamentally different.

### Partiful

<Card title="partiful.com" icon="globe" href="https://partiful.com">
  Social-first, casual, vibrant.
</Card>

Partiful nailed a specific niche — casual social events. Birthday parties, house warmings, happy hours. Their personality is loud and fun and unapologetically playful. The design reflects that — bright colors, animations, personality everywhere. It's the anti-Eventbrite.

What matters here: they proved that event platforms don't have to be boring corporate tools. Personality works. People gravitate toward products that have a point of view.

### Blockchain-native players

A few platforms are already trying to bring blockchain to ticketing. Worth knowing they exist:

- **UTIX** — blockchain ticketing with a technical, infrastructure-first approach. More B2B than consumer-facing.
- **GET Protocol** — one of the original NFT ticketing pioneers. They've been at this for years and have real transaction volume. Proof that the concept works.
- **Seatlab** ([seatlabnft.com](https://seatlabnft.com)) — live NFT ticketing platform focused on the live events space. Clean execution of the core concept.
- **SI Tickets** ([boxoffice.sitickets.com](https://boxoffice.sitickets.com)) — Sports Illustrated's blockchain ticketing play. Bold positioning — they literally marketed themselves as "stop using Eventbrite." Big brand backing, aggressive stance.

<Tip>
The blockchain ticketing players prove the market exists. People WANT verifiable tickets and real ownership. But most of these platforms feel like "blockchain first, user experience second." The opportunity is in flipping that — user experience first, blockchain powering it invisibly underneath.
</Tip>

## What this means for you

Here's the thing I want you to internalize: your platform should feel DIFFERENT from all of these. Not "better Eventbrite." Not "Luma but decentralized." Not "Partiful but for conferences."

Something entirely new.

You've seen what clean design looks like (Luma). You've seen what personality looks like (Partiful). You've seen what reliability looks like (Eventbrite). You've seen that blockchain ticketing has real demand (GET Protocol, Seatlab, SI Tickets).

Now take all of that knowledge, put it in your back pocket, and go build something that is unmistakably yours. Something that when people land on it, they don't say "oh, this is like Luma" — they say "what IS this?"

That's the goal.
