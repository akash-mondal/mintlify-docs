This is your secret weapon. I'm not exaggerating.

[Mobbin](https://mobbin.com) is a library of real screenshots from real apps, organized by design pattern. Thousands of apps. Millions of screens. All searchable, all categorized, all ready for you to study.

When professional designers need to figure out how to design a checkout flow, they don't stare at a blank canvas hoping for inspiration. They go to Mobbin, search "checkout," and study how Stripe, Airbnb, and fifty other apps handle it. Then they synthesize something original from everything they absorbed.

That's exactly what you're going to do.

## How to access it

Log in using my Google account — I'll give you the credentials separately. Not going to put them in a website, obviously. The free tier gives you a limited number of searches, but the account I have should give you plenty of access to work with.

## What to search for

Here's where it gets really useful. You're building an event platform, which means you need to design a lot of different patterns. Mobbin has real-world examples for almost all of them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event registration">
    Search **"event registration"** or **"event booking"** — see how real apps handle the moment someone commits to attending. What information do they ask for? How many steps? What does the confirmation look like?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Checkout and payment">
    Search **"checkout"** or **"payment"** — study payment flows from apps that do it well. How do they handle pricing tiers? Where do they show the total? How do they build trust at the moment of payment?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dashboards">
    Search **"dashboard"** or **"analytics"** — look at how apps present data to organizers and admins. What metrics are front and center? How do they handle empty states vs. populated states? What actions are available?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Onboarding">
    Search **"onboarding"** or **"sign up"** — first impressions matter. How do the best apps welcome new users? How many steps before you're "in"? What do they show vs. what do they skip?
  </Step>
  <Step title="QR codes and scanning">
    Search **"QR code"** or **"scan"** — the check-in experience. How do apps present a QR code to be scanned? What does the scanner interface look like? What happens on a successful scan?
  </Step>
</Steps>

Other searches worth trying: **"ticket"**, **"calendar"**, **"profile"**, **"settings"**, **"notification"**, **"search and filter"**, **"card layout"**, **"form design"**, **"empty state"**, **"loading"**, **"success state"**. Every one of these will surface patterns you can learn from.

## How to actually use it

Don't just browse. Be intentional.

When you find a screen that makes you feel something — that moment of "oh, that's clean" or "I like how they did that" — save it. Mobbin lets you create collections. Build yourself a mood board. Save screens from ten different apps that each do one thing really well. Then step back and look at the collection as a whole.

You'll start to notice patterns. Maybe you gravitate toward minimal designs. Maybe you love bold color. Maybe you keep saving apps with lots of white space, or apps with dark mode, or apps with playful illustrations. That's your taste revealing itself. Pay attention to it.

<Note>
The goal isn't to copy any one app. It's to absorb patterns from many apps and synthesize something that feels like YOU. Fifty inputs, one output. That output is your design.
</Note>

## The designer's workflow

Here's how professionals do it:

1. **Research** — Spend time on Mobbin. Save everything that resonates. Don't filter too hard yet.
2. **Mood board** — Organize your saves into a coherent collection. What's the common thread? What's the vibe?
3. **Wireframe** — Rough layouts in Figma. Boxes and lines. No color, no fonts. Just structure and flow.
4. **High fidelity** — Layer in your color palette, your typography, your brand personality. Now the wireframes become real screens.
5. **Iterate** — Show it to someone (show it to me). Get feedback. Adjust. Show it again.

You don't have to follow this exactly. But the key insight is: research comes first. Design comes from understanding, not from guessing.
