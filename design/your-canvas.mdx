![Your product, your name, your colors, your vibe](/images/your-canvas.png)

This is YOUR product. You decide what it looks like. What it feels like. What the name is. What the vibe is when someone lands on it for the first time.

I'm not going to tell you to make it look like Luma. I'm not going to say "use green because Walrus uses green." I'm not going to hand you a color palette and a logo and say "here, use this." That would defeat the entire point.

You're the designer. Own it.

## What you need to decide

Before you open Figma, before you write a single line of code, before you think about layouts or buttons or animations — you need to answer some fundamental questions about what this thing IS.

**The name.** What is your platform called? Not "Event Registration Platform" — a real name. Something people remember. Something that feels like a product, not a project. Take your time with this. The name shapes everything that comes after it.

**The logo.** Even a simple wordmark is fine to start. This isn't about hiring a graphic designer — it's about having a visual anchor. Something that sits in the top left corner and says "this is a real product."

**The color palette.** Two or three colors that work together and feel intentional. A primary color for buttons and key actions. A secondary for accents. Maybe a dark background variant if you're going that direction. The palette sets the emotional tone of the entire product.

**Typography.** One or two fonts. A heading font with personality. A body font that's clean and readable. That's it. Don't overthink this — but don't skip it either. Typography is the difference between "professional" and "thrown together."

**Tone and personality.** Is your platform serious and enterprise? Playful and social? Minimal and sleek? Warm and community-focused? This isn't about picking the "right" answer. It's about picking YOUR answer and being consistent with it.

## Tools to help you explore

These are tools for exploration, not prescription. Use them to generate options, not to find "the answer." The answer comes from you.

## Take your time with this

I know it's tempting to rush past the "design stuff" and get to the code. But the brand IS the product. A good name and a coherent visual identity make everything else easier. Your registration page flows naturally when the colors and type are locked in. Your marketing makes sense when the tone is clear. Even code decisions get easier when you know what you're building toward.

A product with a strong identity feels like a product. A product without one feels like a homework assignment.

<Note>
You have full permission to experiment. Try a palette, hate it, throw it away. Pick a name, sit with it for a day, change your mind. Design three different logo concepts and trash two of them. That's not wasted time — that's the process. The first idea is almost never the best idea. The fifth version of something is almost always better than the first.
</Note>

Nobody's grading your color choices. Nobody's going to tell you your font is wrong. This is your canvas. Go find what resonates with YOU — then build with conviction.

  Luma looks gorgeous. Eventbrite is everywhere. Partiful is fun. And a handful of blockchain ticketing companies already exist. You need to know what they do well, where they fall short — and why there's a gap only you can fill.
